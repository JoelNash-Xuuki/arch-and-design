Being transparent and being honest are related but distinct concepts in social and psychological contexts.                                                                

Transparency involves openly sharing information, intentions, and processes. It means being clear and open about what you are doing and why, often proactively providing  
information without being asked. Transparency builds trust by reducing uncertainty and allowing others to see the full picture.                                           

Honesty, on the other hand, is about truthfulness and integrity. It involves providing accurate information and not misleading others, even if you are not sharing        
everything. Honesty is about being truthful when asked or when it is necessary to correct misinformation.                                                                 

In summary, transparency is about openness and visibility, while honesty is about truthfulness and integrity. Both are crucial for building trust and effective           
communication.
