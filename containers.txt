Using Docker containers for software development can be a practical   
approach, but there are some considerations:                          

 1 Isolation: Containers provide process-level isolation, not full    
   OS-level isolation like VMs. This means they share the host's      
   kernel, which can be a limitation for certain tasks.               
 2 Persistence: Containers are ephemeral by nature. Ensure you mount  
   volumes for persistent storage of your code and configurations.    
 3 Environment Consistency: Containers are great for maintaining      
   consistent development environments across different machines.     
 4 Performance: Containers generally have less overhead compared to   
   VMs, which can be beneficial for development.                      
 5 Tooling: Ensure your development tools and dependencies are        
   compatible with running inside a container.                        

If these considerations align with your needs, using Docker for       
development can be effective.
